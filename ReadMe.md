ReadMe File

It is super easy to use my project
Here you need to create a copy of all the files i have uploaded on your system and then open Terminal
write the cd command to change directory to the directory where all the files are present
run the command npm i
run the command nodemon index.js
And open the browser and type in localhost:3000/ 
then enjoy putting in our details and getting details of your bank's branch's details.
